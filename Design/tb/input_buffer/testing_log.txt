Ran preliminary random testing on input buffer and found 1 error. The buffer empty signal takes too long to update.
It updates 1 clock cycle after the read and write pointers update which means it takes 2 clock cycles to 
update. It should update immediately after the read and write pointers are equal to each other, so after 1 clock cycle. -(12/11 - John)
