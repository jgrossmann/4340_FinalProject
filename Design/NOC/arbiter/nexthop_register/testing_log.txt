Bug:
On reset, the nexthop register woulld output 000. This doesn't work because 000 corresponds to the north direction
but want it to be no direction. (12/18 - John, Jeff).

Fix:
We changed the reset functionality to change the output direction to the same direction as the corresponding input buffer. 
So the south input buffer would reset to a south nexthop. We did this because our implementation makes it impossible to
send anything in the same direction that it came from. We also OR the reset signal with the buffer empty signal so the
nexthop register will reset to no direction when appropriate. (12/18 - John, Jeff).
