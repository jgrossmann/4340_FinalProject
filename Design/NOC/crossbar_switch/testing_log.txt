“crossbar_switch_inner” is ready to be tested — (11/25, Jeffrey)

After testing "crossbar_switch_inner" with 1 directed test, the results seem
like the functionality is not implemented correctly. After setting the input data
to all of the demuxes to something different for each direction, I then set all of
the demux selectors to north (000) except for the north demux which I set to local (100).
Then, I set the mux selectors so that south output should be the north input, and other
random assignments. All of the outputs displayed correct regardless if the demux
selectors sent the input data into the corresponding mux, which should not have happened.
Check the TestResults.txt for clarification. (11/30, John) 

Bug fixed. Temporary variables were only set correctly for the north mux. The other
muxes had the north mux variables as well. Changed the mux temporary variables to correct
ones.  (11/2, Jeff (written by John))

Retested crossbar_switch_inner and the functionality is working correctly. One thing to note,
if a mux selects a demux that previously was outputting to that path but no longer is, the mux
picks up that old signal. In the real simulation that may go away because there is nothing
driving that signal but it is worth a look at. (11/3, John)
