“crossbar_switch_inner” is ready to be tested — (11/25, Jeffrey)

After testing "crossbar_switch_inner" with 1 directed test, the results seem
like the functionality is not implemented correctly. After setting the input data
to all of the demuxes to something different for each direction, I then set all of
the demux selectors to north (000) except for the north demux which I set to local (100).
Then, I set the mux selectors so that south output should be the north input, and other
random assignments. The key thing to note is that the only one which actually should
have worked was the North input to South output because that was the only path that 
should have been allowed through based on the selectors. However, that was the only one
which did not work. All of the other outputs displayed correct regardless if the demux
selectors sent the input data into the corresponding mux. Check the TestResults.txt for
clarification. (11/30, John)
